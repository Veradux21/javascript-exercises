# DOM Manipulation Homework
## Objectives
- Prove that you can manipulate DOM with JS

## Goals
- [x] create HTML skeleton and link external JS with defer keyword
- [x] add a single div with the ID container
- [ ] Add the following elements to the container using ONLY JS and DOM Manipulation methods
    - [x] a <p> with red text that says “Hey I’m red!”
    - [x] an <h3> with blue text that says “I’m a blue h3!”
    - [x] a <div> with a black border and pink background color with the following elements inside of it:
        - [x] another <h1> that says “I’m in a div”
        - [x] a <p> that says “ME TOO!”
            Hint for this one: after creating the <div> with createElement, append the <h1> and <p> to it before adding it to the container.
